#  Flutterdam

  

**Flutterdam** is a reference code for starters, refreshers and advance Flutter developers.

The goal is to create effective Flutter skeleton, bite size and concise code snippets for everyone to use.

  

**Features:**

Different levels of each category:

- Navigation (go_router,auto_route, ...)

- State management (bloc, riverpod, provider, scoped model, ...)

- Persistence/Storage (flutter_secure_storage, shared_preferences, sqlite, realm, ...)

- Network Requests and monitoring (http, retrofit, chopper, alice ...)

- Extras (native code: method channel)
  

**To use:**

- Every folder is a feature which contains feature_start.dart (example: nl1_screen_start.dart)

- Open **main.dart**, and replace line 15 with your desired start class
